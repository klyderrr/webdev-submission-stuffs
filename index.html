    Hello, <b>special someone.</b><br/><br/>

    <em>It's been about 6 months already since college started.
    It has also been 6 months since we met and became friends.</em><br/><br/>
    When we first met, we weren't that close before, yet here we are updating our stuff together on what's going on with college bs.

<p>
    We barely go out since you're one nanning mf and you like to study, while i'm the opposite, im veryyyyy lazy.
    But regardless though it's pleasing to be friends with you, you're smart and you teach us a lot of stuff when we don't understand it.
    I'm even surprised how we're friends even though i'm not that smart compared to you. But some of our interests align and I guess that's what makes us good friends.
    You're also very friendly, and respectful as well.<br/><br/>

    <strong>Keep doing what you're doing.</strong> I hope life is going your way rn :)<br/><br/>

    <i>your very good friend,</i><br/><br/>
    <b>klyder :D</b>
